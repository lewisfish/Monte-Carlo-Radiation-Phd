		3D SCATTERED LIGHT CODE: POINT SOURCES
		--------------------------------------

This directory contains the source codes for the 3D Cartesian grid. The code is 
set up to simulate emission from an isotropic point source at the centre of the 
grid. The density structure is set to be a uniform density sphere discretised into 
the 3D grid. The code outputs the 3D density grid as an unformatted file. At the 
end of the simulation the code outputs to the screen the average number of scatterings 
per Monte Carlo photon packet.

The FORTRAN files are:

	density.f
	gridset.f
        iarray.f
        mcpolar.f
        ran2.f
        stokes.f
        sourceph.f
        tauint2.f

Include files are:

	grid.txt  
	photon.txt  

Input parameters are in:

	input.params

The file that compiles the code and creates the executable file 'mcgrid' is:

	Makefile
